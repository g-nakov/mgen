A few examples:
* [minimal.mgen](minimal.mgen) - a minimal example of `mgen`'s formal specification demonstrating how to use fields alongside their unit information, enumerated arrays and field-indexed arrays.
* [common.mgen](common.mgen) - a "real-world" example demonstrating the most common features. The generated output code can be found in [common.py](common.py) and [common.m](common.m). A Jupyter [notebook](common.ipynb) with additional details on the Python code generation is also available. Accompanying input (textual) data for testing is stored in [common.in](common.in). 
* [heterogenous.mgen](heterogenous.mgen) - a small example showing how to use field-indexed arrays with different units for each entry.
* [nesting.mgen](nesting.mgen) - an example of demonstrating nesting of structures and addressing nested fields.
